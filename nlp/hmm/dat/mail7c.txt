 Playboy wants to go out with a bang 
 
 
 AN AGEING Berlin playboy has come up with an unusual offer to lure women into
 his bed - by promising the last woman he sleeps with an inheritance of 250,000
 (£160,000). 
 
 Rolf Eden, 72, a Berlin disco owner famous for his countless sex partners,
 said he could imagine no better way to die than in the arms of an attractive
 young woman - preferably under 30. 
 
 "I put it all in my last will and testament - the last woman who sleeps with
 me gets all the money," Mr Eden told Bild newspaper. 
 
 "I want to pass away in the most beautiful moment of my life. First a lot of
 fun with a beautiful woman, then wild sex, a final orgasm - and it will all
 end with a heart attack and then I’m gone." 
 
 Mr Eden, who is selling his nightclub this year, said applications should be
 sent in quickly because of his age. "It could end very soon," he said.
