<h1> Labs </h1>

This repository contains some reports I did during my courses at Télécom ParisTech. For now, one may look at :

* A lab about databases where we use SQL. This is available in the [<tt>databases</tt>](https://github.com/moulinantoine/labs/tree/master/databases) folder.

* A linear regression lab that compares the results obtained with two different methods : one using the theory and another using the library <tt>scikit-learn</tt>. This is available in the [<tt>linear_regression</tt>](https://github.com/moulinantoine/labs/tree/master/linear_regression) folder.

* A lab that compares different methods such as PCA, Forward Variable Selection, Ridge and Lasso. This is available in the [<tt>methods_before_ols</tt>](https://github.com/moulinantoine/labs/tree/master/methods_before_ols) folder.
